# A PhD thesis in High Energy Physics

TODO:

- [ ] Fix typos
- [ ] Fix biblio
- [x] Add likelihood references
- [ ] ECAL detector section
- [ ] Scale factor description
- [ ] Check the large stat unc in ptmiss efficiency plots for Zvv
- [x] Add back missing text on jets
- [x] Reference CMS paper on pileup modelling with recoil
- [ ] Comment on theory systematic correlations between W+jets and Z+jets
- [x] Fig 6.16 mention the large jump in background prefit to postfit
- [ ] Discuss overly conservative uncertainty in ptmiss calibration. Redo?
- [ ] Further discuss the normalisation issue (in footnote) due to xsection bug
- [x] Fig 7.1 bin edge at cut
- [ ] Fig 7.2 comment on disagreement in eta bins
- [x] Explain low QCD multijet in e+jets region (MET cut)
- [ ] Explain what the systematics are
- [ ] Add electron transfer factor distributions
- [ ] Add full set of systematics on recoil prior to TF
- [ ] Separate out where systematics dominate from the TF or not
- [x] Additional discussion on smoothing - show examples
- [ ] Update plots with fixed JEC-based uncertainties
