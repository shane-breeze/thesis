# A PhD thesis in High Energy Physics

TODO:

- [x] Fix typos
- [x] Fix biblio
- [x] Add likelihood references
- [x] Scale of subdetectors
- [x] ECAL detector section
- [x] Scale factor description
- [x] Check the large stat unc in ptmiss efficiency plots for Zvv - Issue in plotting with TEfficiency Feldmann-Cousins interval. Fixed this by eff=1/(1+fail/pass), calculating the poisson up/down interval for the failed and passed events then varying the efficiency under these 4 various hypotheses. The up/down for failed and passed variations are summed in quadrature to obtain the result (since they are uncorrelated).
- [x] Add back missing text on jets
- [x] Reference CMS paper on pileup modelling with recoil
- [ ] Comment on theory systematic correlations between W+jets and Z+jets
- [x] Fig 6.16 mention the large jump in background prefit to postfit
- [ ] Discuss overly conservative uncertainty in ptmiss calibration. Redo?
- [x] Further discuss the normalisation issue (in footnote) due to xsection bug
- [x] Fig 7.1 bin edge at cut
- [ ] Fig 7.2 comment on disagreement in eta bins
- [x] Explain low QCD multijet in e+jets region (MET cut)
- [ ] Explain what the systematics are
- [ ] Add electron transfer factor distributions
- [ ] Add full set of systematics on recoil prior to TF
- [ ] Separate out where systematics dominate from the TF or not
- [x] Additional discussion on smoothing - show examples
- [ ] Update plots with fixed JEC-based uncertainties:
  - [ ] ptmiss calib
  - [ ] w+jets pred
  - [ ] qcd pred
  - [ ] final fit


Maybe todos:

- [ ] More performance numbers for subdetectors
- [ ] Charge misID for mu+ -> mu- transfer factors
