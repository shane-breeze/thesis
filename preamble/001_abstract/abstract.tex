A precision measurement of the partial width of the Z boson decay to an invisible final
state is reported. Events from proton-proton collisions provided by the Large
Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of $\SI{13}{TeV}$ are collected by
the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment with the invisibly decaying Z bosons inferred from
a hadronic recoil. The data collected corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of $\SI{35.9}{fb^{-1}}$. The invisible width is measured to be
$512\pm\SI{16}{MeV}$, consistent with the standard model. This is a competitive result to previous measurements performed at the Large Electron Positron experiment. The measurement is systematically dominated by uncertainties associated with the measurement of
the energy scale of the recoiling hadronic system.
