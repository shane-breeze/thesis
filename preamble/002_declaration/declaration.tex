I hereby declare that the work contained within this thesis is my own. It is produced on top of the existing work and ideas of several individuals and the Compact Muon Solenoid collaboration as a whole. The work performed by others is reviewed by the author, as key aspects in the later stages, in chapters 1--4. Although author contributions have been made to the hardware trigger, they have been omitted in this thesis. Chapter 5 details the event selection and categorisation designed by the author, although inputs are based on work performed by others. Chapter 6 consists of work performed by CMS collaborators and theoreticians, apart from the subsections discussing the \ptmiss trigger efficiency and the \ptmiss calibrations. All remaining chapters details the work done solely by the author.

In addition to the work presented, the author made key contributions to the analysis known as the $\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}$ search \cite{Sirunyan:2018vjp}.

The analysis is currently in the internal CMS review process, with a plan to publish this measurement. All results shown are presented as the work performed by the author and do not represent approved results by the CMS collaboration.
